> **Performance Analysis of Standard Elliptic Curves for the Implementation of ECC on Resource-Constrianed IoT Applications**
>   *July, 2022*
>   Course: Design of Cryptographic Algorithms
>   Abstract: The security of IoT infrastructure has generally relied on the Rivest, Shamir and Adleman (RSA) public key cryptosystem. However, the increasing security requirements in mitigating high computing adversary attacks often translate to an exponential increase in the key size of RSA thereby making it impractical to implement in resource constrained IoT applications where computational speed, storage and bandwidth are limited. Attention has therefore been drawn to the Elliptic Curve cryptography which offers similar security levels at a much smaller key size.  In the ECC however, the choice of curve is the fundamental security framework of the cryptosystem and hence, much thought must be given to the selection of key factors such as the prime field size and the shape of the curve. In this study, sets of elliptic curves suggested by various international standards are chosen, and the selected curves are examined with an emphasis on their performance and security characteristics. Each curve's performance is evaluated in terms of computational cost. The analysis is carried out by taking into account each curve for the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) method and Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) implementations. The comparison table of the chosen curves is presented in accordance with how long it takes each curve to compute different operations when applied to the ECC algorithms.

> **Road-Aware SDN Enabled Routing for the Internet of Vehicles (SD-IoV)**
>   *June, 2022*
>   Course: Mobile Computing Fundamentals
>   Abstract: Proposing an optimal routing protocol for the internet of vehicles with low overhead has proven difficult due to the current architecture's inability to manage flexibility and scalability. As a result, the proposed architecture consolidates an evolving network standard known as software defined networking in the internet of vehicles. By separating the data plane from the control plane, it is able to handle highly dynamic networks in an abstract manner. The road-aware routing strategy is introduced first, which is a performance-enhanced routing protocol designed specifically for infrastructureassisted vehicular networks. Roads are divided into road segments, and roadside units are used for multi-hop communication. The proposed protocol is unique in that it uses the cellular network to relay control messages to and from the controller with low latency. To achieve a real-time vehicle topology, the concept of edge controller is introduced as the operational backbone of the vehicle grid in the internet of vehicles. Last but not least, a novel mathematical model is estimated to assist the primary controller in finding not only the shortest but also the most durable path. The results demonstrate the proposed protocol's significant performance in terms of availability with minimal routing overhead. Furthermore, we discovered that the edge controller is primarily responsible for reducing network path failure.
