1. [July 2022] **Performance Analysis of Standard Elliptic Curves for the Implementation of ECC on Resource-Constrianed IoT Applications**
    > The security of IoT infrastructure has generally relied on the Rivest, Shamir and Adleman (RSA) public key cryptosystem. However, the increasing security requirements in mitigating high computing adversary attacks often translate to an exponential increase in the key size of RSA thereby making it impractical to implement in resource constrained IoT applications where computational speed, storage and bandwidth are limited. Attention has therefore been drawn to the Elliptic Curve cryptography which offers similar security levels at a much smaller key size.  In the ECC however, the choice of curve is the fundamental security framework of the cryptosystem and hence, much thought must be given to the selection of key factors such as the prime field size and the shape of the curve. In this study, sets of elliptic curves suggested by various international standards are chosen, and the selected curves are examined with an emphasis on their performance and security characteristics. Each curve's performance is evaluated in terms of computational cost. The analysis is carried out by taking into account each curve for the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) method and Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) implementations. The comparison table of the chosen curves is presented in accordance with how long it takes each curve to compute different operations when applied to the ECC algorithms.

2. [June 2022] **Road-Aware SDN Enabled Routing for the Internet of Vehicles (SD-IoV)**
    > Proposing an optimal routing protocol for the internet of vehicles with low overhead has proven difficult due to the current architecture's inability to manage flexibility and scalability. As a result, the proposed architecture consolidates an evolving network standard known as software defined networking in the internet of vehicles. By separating the data plane from the control plane, it is able to handle highly dynamic networks in an abstract manner. The road-aware routing strategy is introduced first, which is a performance-enhanced routing protocol designed specifically for infrastructureassisted vehicular networks. Roads are divided into road segments, and roadside units are used for multi-hop communication. The proposed protocol is unique in that it uses the cellular network to relay control messages to and from the controller with low latency. To achieve a real-time vehicle topology, the concept of edge controller is introduced as the operational backbone of the vehicle grid in the internet of vehicles. Last but not least, a novel mathematical model is estimated to assist the primary controller in finding not only the shortest but also the most durable path. The results demonstrate the proposed protocol's significant performance in terms of availability with minimal routing overhead. Furthermore, we discovered that the edge controller is primarily responsible for reducing network path failure.

3. [June 2022] **2022 World cup prediction with Logistic Regression**
    > This  is  a  detailed  report on  how  logistic  regression,  a  numerical analysis  and  machine  learning technique, was used to predict the winners of simulated world cup matches and, ultimately, the tournament champion. I generated a logit model that analyzes key features of paired teams to estimate  the  chance  of  a  team  winning  against  a  particular  opponent  by  examining  three separate  datasets:  a  monthly  FIFA  Ranking  dataset,  a  history  of  past  matches  between  the national teams and the current world cup dataset. With an AUC score of 0.75, the trained model exhibited a 68 percent accuracy which is excellent for the goal of this project.

4. [May 2022] **Design and Analysis of Public Key Cryptosystems**
    > Public  Key  Cryptosystems  (PKC)  have  been  a  great  advancement  to  modern  cryptography  and security in general. With its key-pair feature, along with the defined hard problems, PKC not only solved security issues related to confidentially but also, it has helped to address issues such as authentication  and  non-repudiation.  In  this  report,  I  design  and  discuss  a  couple  of  Public  Key Cryptosystems that seeks to provide both authentication and confidentiality as opposed to the original encryption schemes which lack authentication.

5. [March 2022] **Design of File Transfer & Group Chat Systems**
    > Using socket programming principles, we programmed services to allow file transfer between a client and server. And in another related project, we programmed a group chatbox service that enabled clients to register and join in a live group chat.
