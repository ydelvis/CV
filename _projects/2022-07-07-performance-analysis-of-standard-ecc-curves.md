excerpt: 'The security of IoT infrastructure has generally relied on the Rivest, Shamir and Adleman (RSA) public key cryptosystem. However, the increasing security requirements in mitigating high computing adversary attacks often translate to an exponential increase in the key size of RSA thereby making it impractical to implement in resource constrained IoT applications where computational speed, storage and bandwidth are limited. Attention has therefore been drawn to the Elliptic Curve cryptography which offers similar security levels at a much smaller key size.  In the ECC however, the choice of curve is the fundamental security framework of the cryptosystem and hence, much thought must be given to the selection of key factors such as the prime field size and the shape of the curve. In this study, sets of elliptic curves suggested by various international standards are chosen, and the selected curves are examined with an emphasis on their performance and security characteristics. Each curve's performance is evaluated in terms of computational cost. The analysis is carried out by taking into account each curve for the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) method and Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) implementations. The comparison table of the chosen curves is presented in accordance with how long it takes each curve to compute different operations when applied to the ECC algorithms.'

**Abstract**
> The security of IoT infrastructure has generally relied on the Rivest, Shamir and Adleman (RSA) public key cryptosystem. However, the increasing security requirements in mitigating high computing adversary attacks often translate to an exponential increase in the key size of RSA thereby making it impractical to implement in resource constrained IoT applications where computational speed, storage and bandwidth are limited. Attention has therefore been drawn to the Elliptic Curve cryptography which offers similar security levels at a much smaller key size.  In the ECC however, the choice of curve is the fundamental security framework of the cryptosystem and hence, much thought must be given to the selection of key factors such as the prime field size and the shape of the curve. In this study, sets of elliptic curves suggested by various international standards are chosen, and the selected curves are examined with an emphasis on their performance and security characteristics. Each curve's performance is evaluated in terms of computational cost. The analysis is carried out by taking into account each curve for the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) method and Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) implementations. The comparison table of the chosen curves is presented in accordance with how long it takes each curve to compute different operations when applied to the ECC algorithms.
